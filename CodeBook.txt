The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition.

Data Sources
=============
 File Location -> https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip


Step1: Download the dataset
===========================
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset


Step2: Assign each files to data frames
=======================================

features       -> UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt
activityLabels -> UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt
Xtrain         -> UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt 
ytrain         -> UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt
subjectTrain   -> UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
Xtest          -> UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt
ytest          -> UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt
subjectTest    -> UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt

Step3: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
====================================================================

XData ('data.frame':10299 obs, 561 variables) is created by merging X_train and X_test using rbind() function
yData ('data.frame':10299 obs, 1 variable) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
subjectData ('data.frame':10299 obs, 1 variable) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
MergedData ('data.frame':10299 obs, 563 variables) is created by merging Subject, yData and XData using cbind() function

step4: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
=============================================================================================
create a filtered data (FilteredData set by using grepl function to get only mean and std colmns and the cbind with subject and label to create the 
full filtered set ('data.frame':10299 obs, 88 variables)

Step5: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
==============================================================================

Entire numbers in code column of the Fileterd Data replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

Step6: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
=========================================================================
Label column renamed to Activity
All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

RENAMED FilterdData to TidyDataSet

Step 7: From the data set in step 6(step4 in assignment), creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
========================================================================================================================================================

FinalTidyDataSet (180 rows, 81 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export FinalTidyDataSet into FinalTidyData.txt file.
